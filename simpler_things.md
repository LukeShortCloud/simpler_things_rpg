# Simpler Things RPG

## Characters

### Traits

Traits effect how good a character is at related Skills.

* Awareness = Social skills and mental strength.
* Knowledge = Philosophy.
* Vitality = Health and power.

### Species

Based on the Species, a player will start with different ranks for their Traits. The maximum number a character can have in any Trait is 10.

| Name | Awareness | Knowledge | Vitality |
| ---- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| Alien | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| Human | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| Robot | 2 | 4 | 2 |

## Skills

Each Trait has four related Skills.

| Name | Trait |
| ---- | ----- |
| Convincing | Awareness |
| Driving | Knowledge |
| Electronics | Knowledge |
| Examination | Awareness |
| Geography | Knowledge |
| Healing | Vitality |
| Magic\* | Awareness |
| Lore | Knowledge |
| Sneak | Awareness |
| Stunts | Vitality |
| Weapons (near) | Vitality |
| Weapons (far) | Vitality |

Notes:

- \*Magic can only be used by player characters that start the game with it as an Expertise.

### Jobs

Jobs provide characters with a set of two different Skills Expertise to start off with. A character can only become an Expert in a Skill once. An Expertise adds an extra `1d6` to the related Skill Checks. It also allows Good Epic Events to occur. The Player Characters get to determine what their Job title is and what two related Skills they want to have.

### Creation

* Pick a Species.
* Pick a Job.
* Buy Items with a budget of $1000. Players get to keep the unspent money.

### Leveling Up

* The Game Master determines when the Player Characters level up. Examples of when may be a good time to have players level up:
    * A big quest is completed.
    * Lots of little quests are completed.
    * Every game session.
* Every four level ups (5, 9, 13, etc.), a player gets a new Expertise of their choice.

## Health

Health = (Vitality x 10) + Armor

Possible Health:

* Minimum = (2 x 10) + 0 = 20
* Maximum = (10 x 10) + 25 = 125

When a player character's health is at...

* 0 = They can no longer make an action.
* -10 = Their armor breaks and cannot be repaired/reused.
* -20 = They will get a permanent disability (determined by the GM) and loose at least one Trait point.
* -30 = They die.

## Dice

These are the different types of dice used for Simpler Things.

| Name | Dice Sides | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| ---- | ---------- | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | -- |
| Omen | 2 | Good | Bad |
| Skill Check (Action) | 6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| Skill Check (Side Effect) | 6 | Negative | Negative | Neutral | Neutral | Positive | Positive |
| Weapons damage | 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

### Skill Checks

When a Player Character (PC) wants to perform an Action, they must tell the party or at least the Game Master (GM). Determine the most related Skill for the Action. The GM determines the Difficulty. This is the result that is required for the Action to work. The PC then rolls `1d6` (or `2d6` if the Skill is an Expertise).

Difficulty:
- Easiest/minimum = 3
- Hardest/maximum = 12

The GM can determine that a Difficulty needs to be higher than 6. The maximum required result is 12. This requires the PC to have an Expertise in the Skill for them to be able to possibly pass the Skill Check. The Expertise allows them to roll an additional `1d6`.

**Side Effects**

After a Skill Check, the Player Character must also separately roll `1d6` to determine if there is a Side Effect. The Game Master (GM) determines what the Side Effect will be. It should relate to the Action that was attempted.

Side Effects:
- 1-2 = Negative
- 3-4 = Neutral or Nothing
- 5-6 = Positive

The GM tells the players what happens in the game regarding the results of the Skill Check and Side Effect.

**Epic Events**

An Epic Event is when something amazing happens. There are two types: Good and Bad.

A Good Epic Event requires that a Player Character (PC) has an Expertise in a Skill and rolls a total result of 12 for their `2d6` Skills Check. A PC without an Expertise in a Skill can only, at most, get a result of 6 and not 12 because they can only roll `1d6`. The PC can describe exactly what happens with their Action. The event should be within reason and must be approved by the Game Master (GM). If damage is being dealt, it will be doubled.

A Bad Epic Event is triggered slightly differently. A PC must roll at least one die that has a result of 1. Then the Side Effect die roll must also result in a 1. The GM determines what horrible thing happens to the PC.

### Omens (Optional)

Before the start of every game session, each Player Character (PC) flips a coin (`1d2`). Heads (1) provides a Good Omen for the player and tails (2) provides a Bad Omen for the GM to use against the player. Each Omen can only be used once for that game session.

A Good Omen allows a Player Character to add an extra `1d6` to any Skill Check. If that character has an Expertise in a Skill, they will roll `3d6` total. A Bad Omen allows the GM to increase the Difficulty of a Skill Check by 4. The maximum Difficulty cannot exceed 12.

### Turn Order

All players (PCs and NPCs) must roll a `1d12` (or `2d6`) for their initiative and then add their Awareness to the result. The player with the highest result goes first and then the Turn Order continues in descending order.

Summary:

* Turn Order = `1d12 + AWARENESS`
* Go in descending order of everyone's results.

## Items

### Armor

| Name | Health Boost | Cost |
| ---- | ------------ | ---- |
| Tier 1 | 5 | 500 |
| Tier 2 | 10 | 1000 |
| Tier 3 | 15 | 2000 |
| Tier 4 | 20 | 4000 |
| Tier 5 | 25 | 8000 |

### Weapons

Each Weapon has a Difficulty which determines the standard Skill Check, the amount of `d4` dice to roll for damage, and the cost.

- Damage = `DIFFICULTY x d4`
- Cost = `DIFFICULTY x 200`

#### Weapons (near)

| Name | Difficulty |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Knife | 3 |
| Staff | 4 |
| Hammer | 5 |
| Axe | 6 |
| Sword | 6 |
| Sword, Plasma | 8 |

#### Weapons (far)

| Name | Difficulty |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Slingshot | 3 |
| Spear | 4 |
| Bow | 5 |
| Pistol | 6 |
| Crossbow | 7 |
| Assault Rifle | 8 |
| \*Grenades (3 pack) | 9 |
| Shotgun | 10 |
| Sniper Rifle | 11 |
| \*Grenade, Super (1 pack) | 12 |

\*Grenades have a one-time use and do damage in an area of 10 meters.

**Vehicle**

Vehicle damage is multiplied by 10.

| Name | Difficulty |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Turret (small) | 4 |
| Turret (large) | 8 |

### Healing

Healing requires the use of a Medical Kit. It works similar to Weapons in that a successful Skill Check will result in `DIFFICULTY x d4` of health to be restored. Healing includes repairing armor which should be treated as additional health. Armor only gets destroyed if a player reaches -10 health.

## Magic

Magic is difficult to use yet very powerful when it actually works. Only a character with Expertise in Magic can use it. Characters have access to all of the available Spells.

Using Magic that is labeled as a Bad Omen will add a Bad Omen against the player casting the spell.

| Spell | Rank | Bad Omen | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| Brainwash | 6 | No | Manipulate the brain of another character to make them believe or do something temporarily. |
| Crush | 8 | Yes | Exert pressure all around a character or thing to crush it. Does `8d4` damage. |
| Heal | 8 | No | Heal a character for `8d4` health. |
| Heal, Steal | 8 | Yes | Steal health from another character. Take `8d4` health away from the other character and add it to the caster's health. |
| Kill | 12 | Yes | Instantly kill any character of equal or lesser Vitality. |
| Move | 6 | No | Move objects around with the mind. |
| Revive | 12 | No | Revive a recently killed character. |
