# Simpler Things RPG

## Characters

### Traits

Traits effect how good a character is at related Skills.

* Awareness = Social skills and mental strength.
* Knowledge = Philosophy.
* Vitality = Health and power.

### Species

Based on the Species, a player will start with different ranks for their Traits. The maximum number a character can have in any Trait is 10.

| Name | Awareness | Knowledge | Vitality |
| ---- | ------ | --------- | -------- |
| Alien | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| Human | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| Robot | 2 | 4 | 2 |

## Skills

Each Trait has four related Skills.

| Name | Trait |
| ---- | ----- |
| Convincing | Awareness |
| Driving | Knowledge |
| Electronics | Knowledge |
| Examination | Awareness |
| Geography | Knowledge |
| Healing\* | Vitality |
| Magic\*\* | Awareness |
| Lore | Knowledge |
| Sneak | Awareness |
| Stunts | Vitality |
| Weapons (blades) | Vitality |
| Weapons (ranged) | Vitality |

Notes:

* \*Healing takes two turns to complete, instead of one.
* \*\*Magic can only be used by player characters that start the game with it as an Expertise.

### Jobs

Jobs provide characters with a set of three different Skills Expertise to start off with. A character can only become an Expert in a Skill once. An Expertise adds an extra 1d6 to the related Skill check.

| Job | Expertise 1 | Expertise 2 | Expertise 3 |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Administrator | Healing | Electronics | Weapons (ranged) |
| Adventurer | Examination | Geography | Lore |
| Doctor | Driving | Examination | Healing |
| Electrician | Electronics | Examination | Weapons (blades) |
| Hacker | Electronics | Sneak | Stunts |
| Monk | Healing | Lore | Magic |
| Ninja | Sneak | Stunts | Weapons (blades) |
| Nomad | Lore | Magic | Weapons (ranged) |
| Officer | Healing | Stunts | Weapons (ranged) |
| Pilot | Driving | Electronics | Geography
| Protector | Convincing | Magic | Weapons (blades) |
| Refugee | Magic | Sneak | Weapons (ranged) |
| Secret Agent | Convincing | Examination | Sneak
| Swordsman | Geography | Stunts | Weapons (blades) |
| Teacher | Convincing | Geography | Lore |

### Creation

* Pick a Species.
* Pick a Job.
* Buy Items with a budget of $1000. Players get to keep the unspent money.

### Leveling Up

* Every level up, a player can add one point to any Trait.
* Every four level ups (5, 9, 13, etc.), a player gets a new Expertise of their choice.

## Health

Health = Vitality + Armor + 10

Possible Health:

* Minimum = 2 + 0 + 10 = 12
* Maximum = 10 + 25 + 10 = 45

When a player character's health is at...

* 0 = They can no longer make an action.
* -10 = Their armor breaks and cannot be repaired/reused.
* -20 = They will get a permanent disability (determined by the GM) and loose at least one Trait point.
* -30 = They die.

Healing will affect both a character's pure health and their armor.

## Dice

These are the different types of dice used in Simpler Things. The dice that will be most commonly used are d6 and d4 for the Action and Weapons damage (character sized).

Recommended dice:

* Five d4, d6, and d10.

| Name | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| ---- | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Action | | | | Pass | Improvement | Pass and Improvement |
| Omen | Bad | Bad | Bad | Good | Good | Good |

| Name | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| ---- | - | - | - | - |
| Weapons damage (character sized) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

| Name | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| ---- | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | -- |
| Weapons damage (vehicle sized) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |

### Skill Checks

**Actions**

When a player wants to do an Action with a Skill, they must roll for it. There are two pools of dice that are rolled. The first is by the PC based on their Trait and, if available, their Expertise of a Skill. The second is handled by the GM representing the environment or a NPC based on how Challenging they think the Action should be. The results of both cancel each other. One Pass from the GM cancels out one Pass from the PC. The PC needs at least one Pass to complete the Action.

The dice pool for the PC is a group of d6 dice. The related Trait of the Skill will need to be looked up. The PC's level in that Trait determines the number of d6 dice to roll. If they also have an Expertise in the Skill, they get to roll an extra 1d6.

**Improvements**

If a character gets at least one Improvement then something favorable happens to them, even if the Action they were doing does not Pass. Getting a negative Improvement will result in something undesirable happening as a result of the Action. The GM decides what the favorable or undesirable outcome is.

**Challenge**

The GM determines the Challenge of a Skills check based on the situation. The harder an action is estimated to be, the more Action dice the GM rolls against the PCs. If the GM rolls more Passes than the PC, then the PC's Action does not pass. If the GM rolls more Improvements than the PC, then a negative event happens to the PC.

The GM may use any number of Action or Expertise dice, based on what they think the Challenge of a scenario should be.

**Epic Events**

Getting five Improvements OR rolling four dice with a result of 6 on each one will result in an Epic Event. The PC can describe exactly what happens during with their Action (within reason and with approval of the GM). If damage is being dealt, it will be doubled.

Summary:

* Triggers for an Epic Event
    * Five Improvements or...
    * Four "6" results from a d6 Action roll.

### Omens

During the first session of the game, each PC should flip a coin or roll a d6 to determine if they get a Bad (1-3) or Good (4-6) Omen. With a Good Omen, a PC can add two extra Action dice to their dice pool. With a Bad Omen, the GM can add two extra Action die to for a NPC that is using an Action. Alternatively, the GM may also use two extra Action die for a Challenge Check. Once an Omen is used, it is converted to the opposite side. This means that when a Good Omen is used it becomes a Bad Omen. An Omen for/against a PC can only be used twice per session. The PCs should record what Omen type they have at the end of each session.

Summary:

* An Omen can be Good (helps the PC) or Bad (helps the GM).
* Omens for/against a character can only be used twice per game session (usually one Good and one Bad).
* An Omen adds 2d6 to a Skills Check for an Action.

### Turn Order

All players (PCs and NPCs) must roll a 1d12 (or 2d6) for their initiative and then add their Awareness to the result. The player with the highest result goes first and then the Turn Order continues in descending order.

Summary:

* Turn Order = `1d12 + AWARENESS`
* Go in descending order of everyone's results.

### Examples

Passes:
*  If there was one Pass for the PC and two Passes for the GM means that the player fails at their Action (they got -1 Pass).

Expertise:
* A roll for a character with the Geography (Expertise) who has a Knowledge (Trait) of six will get to roll seven Action dice. They get the extra dice for having an Expertise in the Skill.

Epic Event:
* A player happens to have gotten a maximum of six Improvements from rolling two Expertise dice for their Electronics check. This results in an Epic Event (6 >= 5). The player describes how they managed to access the system using their own decryption method and gained additional information about their arch nemesis that the group was not originally planning on finding.

Omens:
* A player tries to make an ambitious jump from one cliff to another. That player has a Bad Omen so the GM decides to make it harder for them and uses it to add an extra Expertise die against them. After this, the player gets a Good Omen they can use during the next game session.

Turn Order:
* PC 1 has ten points in Awareness and rolls an eleven from a 1d12. Their Turn Order would be 14 (11 + (10 / 3)) . PC 2 has two points in Awareness and rolls a maximum of 12 from a 1d12. Their Turn Order would be 12 (12 + (2 / 3)). PC 1 goes first. PC 2 goes after them.

## Items

| Tier 3 | 15 | 2000 |
| Tier 4 | 20 | 4000 |
| Tier 5 | 25 | 8000 |

### Weapons

Each Weapon has a Rank based on how easy or hard it is to use. The Rank is the number of Passes required for the Weapon to successfully attack with. It is also the number of dice to roll for the attack damage. Character sized weapons do d4 damage. Vehicle sized weapons do d10 damage. For example, an Assault Rifle that has Rank 2 will require two Passes. For damage, 2d4 dice will be rolled.

Summary:

* Rank = Passes required to successfully attack with that Weapon.
* Rank = If the attack Passes, use the Rank number of d4 or d10 dice to roll for damage.

#### Weapons (blades)

| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Knife | 1 | 100 |
| Quarterstaff | 2 | 300 |

## Magic

Magic is difficult to use yet very powerful when it actually works. Only a character with Expertise in Magic can use it. They have access to all of the available Spells.

Using Magic that is labeled as a Bad Omen will convert a character's Good Omen into a Bad Omen. If the character already has a Bad Omen then they are unaffected.

## Quick Start

* The Game Master (GM) decides the genre, time, and setting for a game.
* Player Characters (PCs) use a Character Sheet and fill it out by following the Characters Creation guide.
* Each PC rolls `1d6` to determine if they start with a Bad (1, 2, or 3) or Good (4, 5, or 6) Omen.
* PCs can interact with anything in the game based off of their Skills and the related Traits. This is called an Action.
    * `Trait x d6`
    * If they have an Expertise in a Skill, they can roll one extra six-sided die.
    * A Good Omen can be used once per session (and then converted into a Bad Omen) to add two six-sided die to the Action pool.
* The GM decides how Challenging an Action is based on the situation.
    * `Challenge x d6`
    * A Bad Omen against a PC can be used once per session (and then converted into a Good Omen for them) to add two six-sided die to the Challenge pool.
    * Every Pass and Improvement from the GM’s dice roll negates what the PC rolled.
* The GM determines the output of an Action.
    * Positive or Negative Pass = The PC successfully completes or fails their Action.
    * Positive or Negative Improvement = A good or bad side-effect happens as a result of the Action (determined by the GM).
    * Epic Event (Five Improvements or four separate dice results of “6”) = The Action is so perfectly executed that something amazing happens. If the PC triggers an Epic Event, they can narrate what happens.
        * If this is for a Weapons related Action, the damage will be doubled.
* Combat
    * Everyone rolls for their Turn Order. The characters with the highest number goes first.
        * `1d12 + (Awareness / 3)`
    * For a Weapons Action to Pass, a character must get the same number of Passes as the number of Rank the Weapon has listed.
        * If the Action Passes, the character rolls `Weapon Rank x d4` for damage for normal handheld Weapons. For vehicle Weapons, the roll for damage is `Weapon Rank x d10`.
* Magic
    * Works the same as any normal Skill check except it requires that a character has an Expertise in Magic to use it at all.
    * If it Passes, the PC can narrate what happens as a result of their Action (within reason and with approval from the GM).
