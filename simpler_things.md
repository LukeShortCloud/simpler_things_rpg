# Simpler Things RPG

## Characters

### Traits

Traits effect how good a character is at related Skills.

* Awareness = Social skills and mental strength.
* Knowledge = Philosophy.
* Vitality = Health and power.

### Species

Based on the Species, a player will start with different ranks for their Traits. The maximum number a character can have in any Trait is 10.

| Name | Awareness | Knowledge | Vitality |
| ---- | ------ | --------- | -------- |
| Alien | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| Human | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| Robot | 2 | 4 | 2 |

## Skills

Each Trait has four related Skills.

| Name | Trait |
| ---- | ----- |
| Convincing | Awareness |
| Driving | Knowledge |
| Electronics | Knowledge |
| Examination | Awareness |
| Geography | Knowledge |
| Healing\* | Vitality |
| Magic\*\* | Awareness |
| Lore | Knowledge |
| Sneak | Awareness |
| Stunts | Vitality |
| Weapons (blades) | Vitality |
| Weapons (ranged) | Vitality |

Notes:

* \*Healing takes two turns to complete, instead of one.
* \*\*Magic can only be used by player characters that start the game with it as an Expertise.

### Jobs

Jobs provide characters with a set of three different Skills Expertise to start off with. A character can only become an Expert in a Skill once. An Expertise adds an extra `1d6` to the related Skill check.

| Job | Expertise 1 | Expertise 2 | Expertise 3 |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Administrator | Healing | Electronics | Weapons (ranged) |
| Adventurer | Examination | Geography | Lore |
| Doctor | Convincing | Examination | Healing |
| Electrician | Electronics | Examination | Weapons (blades) |
| Hacker | Electronics | Sneak | Stunts |
| Monk | Healing | Lore | Magic |
| Ninja | Sneak | Stunts | Weapons (blades) |
| Nomad | Lore | Magic | Weapons (ranged) |
| Officer | Healing | Stunts | Weapons (ranged) |
| Pilot | Driving | Electronics | Geography
| Protector | Driving | Magic | Weapons (blades) |
| Refugee | Magic | Sneak | Weapons (ranged) |
| Secret Agent | Convincing | Examination | Sneak
| Swordsman | Geography | Stunts | Weapons (blades) |
| Teacher | Convincing | Geography | Lore |

### Creation

* Pick a Species.
* Pick a Job.
* Buy Items with a budget of $1000. Players get to keep the unspent money.

### Leveling Up

* Every level up, a player can add one point to any Trait.
* Every four level ups (5, 9, 13, etc.), a player gets a new Expertise of their choice.

## Health

Health = Vitality + Armor + 10

Possible Health:

* Minimum = 2 + 0 + 10 = 12
* Maximum = 10 + 25 + 10 = 45

When a player character's health is at...

* 0 = They can no longer make an action.
* -10 = Their armor breaks and cannot be repaired/reused.
* -20 = They will get a permanent disability (determined by the GM) and loose at least one Trait point.
* -30 = They die.

Healing will affect both a character's pure health and their armor.

## Dice

These are the different types of dice used for Simpler Things.

| Name | Dice Sides | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| ---- | ---------- | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | -- |
| Omen | `2 | Good | Bad |
| Skill Check (Action and Side Effect) | 6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| Weapons damage (character sized) | 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| Weapons damage (vehicle sized) | 10 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |

### Skill Checks

Player: When a player wants to perform an Action, they must tell the party (or at least the GM) and do a Skill Check. Determine the most related Skill for the Action. Based on that Skill, the player must roll their `TRAIT` number of `d6`. Add `1d6` to the dice pool if the Skill is an Expertise they player has.

GM: The GM determines the Challenge of the Action and rolls any number of `d6` accordingly. The harder the Challenge, the more dice in the pool. Both the player and the GM need to add together the numbers that were rolled to determine each of their Results.The player will Pass a Skill Check if their Result is higher than the GM's Result.

**Side Effects**

A player must also separately roll `1d6` to determine if there is a Side Effect. If the player has an Expertise in the related Skill, add one to that Result. The GM determines what the Side Effect will be. It should relate to the Action that was (or was not) performed.

- 1-2 = Negative
- 3-4 = Neutral or Nothing
- 5-6 = Positive

The GM tells the players what happens in the game regarding the Results of the Action and Side Effect.

**Epic Events**

An Epic Event is triggered if the player rolls at least `4d6` with a natural 6 on each of the four die. For an Epic Event, the player can describe exactly what happens with their Action. The event should be within reason and must be approved by the GM. If damage is being dealt, it will be doubled.

### Omens

Before the start of every game session, each player should flip a coin (`1d2`). Heads (1) provides a Good Omen for the player and tails (2) provides a Bad Omen for the GM to use against the player. Each Omen can only be used once for that game session. An Omen adds `2d6` to any Skill Check.

### Turn Order

All players (PCs and NPCs) must roll a `1d12` (or `2d6`) for their initiative and then add their Awareness to the result. The player with the highest result goes first and then the Turn Order continues in descending order.

Summary:

* Turn Order = `1d12 + AWARENESS`
* Go in descending order of everyone's results.

### Examples

Passes:
*  If there was one Pass for the PC and two Passes for the GM means that the player fails at their Action (they got -1 Pass).

Expertise:
* A roll for a character with the Geography (Expertise) who has a Knowledge (Trait) of six will get to roll seven Action dice. They get the extra dice for having an Expertise in the Skill.

Epic Event:
* A player does a Skill Check for Electronics. They roll `5d6` and get the numbers: 4, 6, 6, 6, and 6. This triggers an Epic Event. The player describes how they managed to access the system using their own decryption method and gained additional information about their arch nemesis that the group was not originally planning on finding there.

Omens:
* A player tries to make an ambitious jump from one cliff to another. That player has a Bad Omen and the GM decides to make it harder for themto succeed. The GM upgrades the difficulty of the `Stunts` Skill check by adding `2d6`.

Turn Order:
* PC 1 has ten points in Awareness and rolls an eleven from a `1d12`. Their Turn Order would be 16 (11 + (10 / 2)) . PC 2 has two points in Awareness and rolls a maximum of 12 from a `1d12`. Their Turn Order would be 18 (12 + (12 / 2)). PC 1 goes first. PC 1 can do an action after PC 2.

## Items

### Armor

| Name | Health Boost | Cost |
| ---- | ------------ | ---- |
| Tier 1 | 5 | 500 |
| Tier 2 | 10 | 1000 |
| Tier 3 | 15 | 2000 |
| Tier 4 | 20 | 4000 |
| Tier 5 | 25 | 8000 |

### Weapons

Each Weapon has a Rank based on how easy or hard it is to use. The Rank is the number of Passes required for the Weapon to successfully attack with. It is also the number of dice to roll for the attack damage. Character sized weapons do d4 damage. Vehicle sized weapons do d10 damage. For example, an Assault Rifle that has Rank 2 will require two Passes. For damage, `2d4` dice will be rolled.

Summary:

* Rank = Passes required to successfully attack with that Weapon.
* Rank = If the attack Passes, use the Rank number of d4 or d10 dice to roll for damage.

#### Weapons (blades)

## Quick Start

* The Game Master (GM) decides the genre, time, and setting for a game.
* Player Characters (PCs) use a Character Sheet and fill it out by following the Characters Creation guide.
* Each PC rolls `1d2` to determine if they start with a Good (1) or Bad (2) Omen.
* PCs can interact with anything in the game based off of their Skills and the related Traits. This is called an Action.
    * `TRAIT x d6`
    * If they have an Expertise in a Skill, they can roll one extra six-sided die.
    * An Omen can be used once per game session to add two six-sided die (`2d6`) to the Action pool.
* The GM decides how Challenging an Action is based on the situation.
    * `CHALLENGE x d6`
* The GM determines the output of an Action.
    * Positive or Negative Pass = The PC successfully completes or fails their Action.
    * Positive or Negative Side Effect = A good or bad side effect (related event) happens as a result of the Action. This is determined by the GM.
    * Epic Event (four separate `1d6` dice naturally land on a 6) = The Action is so perfectly executed that something amazing happens. If the PC triggers an Epic Event, they can narrate what happens.
        * If this is for a Weapons related Action, the damage will be doubled.
* Combat
    * Everyone rolls for their Turn Order. The characters with the highest number goes first.
        * `1d12 + AWARENESS`
    * For a Weapons Action to Pass, a character must get the same number of Passes as the number of Rank the Weapon has listed.
        * If the Action Passes, the character rolls `WEAPON RANK x d4` for damage for normal handheld Weapons. For vehicle Weapons, the roll for damage is `WEAPON RANK x d10`.
* Magic
    * Works the same as any normal Skill check except it requires that a character has an Expertise in Magic to use it at all.
    * If it Passes, the PC can narrate what happens as a result of their Action (within reason and with approval from the GM).
